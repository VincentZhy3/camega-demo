    <p>Learn why Camega products are proudly NPN-certified — and how Canada's health regulations protect you.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-content">
    <p>At Camega, we believe you deserve more than marketing claims — you deserve proof. That's why every Camega product carries a Natural Product Number (NPN) issued by Health Canada. This isn't just a label — it's your assurance that what's inside is exactly what we say it is, and that it's been independently verified for safety, quality, and efficacy.</p>

    <h3>What Is an NPN?</h3>
    <p>An NPN is an 8-digit government-issued number required for every natural health product sold legally in Canada. To receive it, a product must go through a comprehensive pre-market evaluation by Health Canada. This includes detailed assessments of the ingredients, health claims, clinical or traditional evidence, recommended dosage, risk warnings, and manufacturing practices.</p>
  
    <h3>How Does Canada's System Compare Globally?</h3>
    <p>Many countries rely on voluntary certifications or post-market enforcement. Canada stands out for its rigorous, government-regulated, <strong>pre-market approval system</strong>. This ensures only products that have been scientifically reviewed are allowed on store shelves.</p>
  
    <h3>NPN vs. Other Certifications</h3>
    <p>We fully respect other certifications — and in fact, we support many of them. But it's important to understand how they compare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IFOS (International Fish Oil Standards):</strong> Independent lab testing for Omega-3 quality, but voluntary and batch-specific — not comprehensive or government-backed.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-GMO Project:</strong> Focused only on genetic modification, not overall safety or efficacy.</li>
      <li><strong>USP & NSF:</strong> U.S.-based standards that confirm identity and purity — but don't evaluate health claims or require government approval before sale.</li>
      <li><strong>FDA "GRAS" or "Dietary Supplement" status:</strong> In the U.S., supplements do not require FDA approval before hitting the market. GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) is often based on self-submission by companies, not formal pre-market evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>In contrast, Canada's NPN system is government-regulated, mandatory, and holistic.</strong> It evaluates the product's safety, efficacy, and labeling — not just a slice of the picture.</p>
  
    <h3>What NPN Means for You</h3>
    <p>When you see an NPN on a Camega product, it guarantees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every ingredient — active and inactive — is reviewed for safety.</li>
      <li>All health claims are backed by solid evidence (clinical or traditional).</li>
      <li>Dosage and usage instructions are validated by experts.</li>
      <li>Side effects, warnings, and drug interactions are clearly stated.</li>
      <li>Manufacturing follows certified Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Why Camega Chooses NPN — Even When It's Harder</h3>
    <p>It takes months — sometimes years — to obtain an NPN. That's time, cost, and effort many companies avoid by selling in less regulated markets. But we believe your health is worth the extra step. At Camega, we don't just aim to meet standards — we aim to set them.</p>
  
    <h3>Other Certifications Still Matter — But They're Not Enough</h3>
    <p>We proudly support additional certifications and third-party testing. For example, IFOS ensures our Omega-3s exceed international purity benchmarks, and our formulas are crafted with Non-GMO and sustainably sourced ingredients. But all of these start with — and build on — the NPN foundation. Without it, they're just parts of the puzzle.</p>
  
    <h3>Trust Backed by Regulation</h3>
    <p>When it comes to your health, we don't believe in shortcuts. The NPN system represents Canada's global leadership in supplement safety — and Camega is proud to be part of that legacy. We're not here to sell you trends. We're here to deliver science-backed, government-approved natural health products that work.</p>
